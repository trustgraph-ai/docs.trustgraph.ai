# Features

Explore TrustGraph's comprehensive feature set designed for building intelligent AI agents.

## Core Features

### Knowledge Graph Construction
Transform enterprise data into interconnected knowledge structures that preserve relationships and context. TrustGraph automatically identifies entities, relationships, and hierarchies within your data.

### GraphRAG Technology
Advanced Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation that goes beyond traditional RAG approaches. Instead of retrieving isolated documents, GraphRAG understands the relationships between data points for more contextual responses.

### AI Agent Intelligence
Build sophisticated AI agents that can reason about complex relationships in your data. Agents understand not just what information exists, but how different pieces of information connect and relate to each other.

### Knowledge Packages
Combine Knowledge Graphs with Vector Embeddings to create comprehensive "Knowledge Packages" that provide both structured relationships and semantic similarity search capabilities.

### Multi-Technology Integration
Flexible architecture that supports integration with:
- Multiple Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Various vector databases
- Different graph database systems
- Enterprise data sources

### Open Source Transparency
Complete visibility into how your data is processed, transformed, and used by AI agents. No black boxes or vendor lock-in.

## Advanced Features

### Contextual Reasoning
Agents can perform sophisticated reasoning about relationships between data points, reducing hallucinations and improving accuracy.

### Enterprise Data Unification
Break down data silos by connecting fragmented information across your organization into coherent knowledge systems.

### Scalable Architecture
Designed to handle enterprise-scale data processing and knowledge graph construction with high performance and reliability.

### Developer-Friendly APIs
Comprehensive APIs and SDKs for integrating TrustGraph into your applications and workflows.
