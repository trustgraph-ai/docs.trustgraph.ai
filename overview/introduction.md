# Introduction to TrustGraph

TrustGraph is an **Open Source Agent Intelligence Platform** that transforms
AI agents from simple task executors into intelligent, contextually-aware
systems. Unlike traditional AI approaches that work with isolated data points,
TrustGraph creates interconnected knowledge structures that enable agents to
understand relationships and context.

<h3>Context Graph Technologies</h3>
</div>
<div class="feature-card-content">
<ul>
<li><strong>Context Graph Factory</strong> — Transforms fragmented data into interconnected "Context Graphs" rather than relying on simple vector search, enabling superior reasoning through graph-based context</li>
<li><strong>Reduced AI hallucinations</strong> — Grounds LLMs with accurate, contextual information through intelligent context grounding rather than just retrieval</li>
<li><strong>Context Cores</strong> — Reusable, modular context bases that can be dynamically loaded and removed at runtime</li>
<li><strong>GraphRAG integration</strong> — Combines knowledge graphs with vector search for enhanced retrieval-augmented generation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Deployment & Architecture</h3>
</div>
<div class="feature-card-content">
<ul>
<li><strong>Single-command deployment</strong> — Launch entire agentic infrastructure with <code>docker compose up -d</code></li>
<li><strong>Fully containerized & modular</strong> — Transparent, open-source design with end-to-end context management</li>
<li><strong>Run anywhere</strong> — Local, on-premise, or multi-cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP, OVHcloud, Scaleway, Kubernetes)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Flexibility & Integrations</h3>
</div>
<div class="feature-card-content">
<ul>
<li><strong>40+ LLM providers</strong> — Works with Anthropic, OpenAI, Google VertexAI, AWS Bedrock, and more</li>
<li><strong>Multiple graph store options</strong> — Neo4j, Apache Cassandra, Memgraph, FalkorDB</li>
<li><strong>Multiple vector DB options</strong> — Qdrant, Pinecone, Milvus</li>
<li><strong>MCP interoperability</strong> — Native Model Context Protocol integration for external tool connections</li>

## Deep Dive

### Knowledge Representation

TrustGraph uses graph technology and decades' worth of knowledge
representation to power GraphRAG and Ontology RAG. This is a core part
of how contexts are extracted, stored, and formed into contexts for LLMs
to process.

### Context Cores

This is the name we give to a file which encapsulates all of the knowledge
gained from context extraction.  In this form, the cores are easy to store
offline, share and reload.  Context cores load into the stores in 1% of the
time taken to create the original knowledge.

### Extensible

All of TrustGraph is built using open APIs which can be 3rd-party extended
so you can add your own custom, private capabilities.

## Key Benefits

### Reduced Hallucinations
By grounding AI responses in structured knowledge graphs, TrustGraph significantly reduces the likelihood of AI generating false or misleading information.

### Contextual Intelligence
Agents understand not just what information exists, but how different pieces of information relate to each other.

### Enterprise Integration
Unifies fragmented organizational knowledge into coherent, queryable knowledge systems.

### Transparency
Full visibility into how data is processed and how AI agents arrive at their responses.

### Flexibility
Open-source architecture prevents vendor lock-in and enables customization.
