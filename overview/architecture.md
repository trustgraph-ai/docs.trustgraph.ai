</a>

TrustGraph follows a modular, microservices-based architecture that enables scalable knowledge graph construction and AI agent deployment. The platform is designed to integrate with existing enterprise infrastructure while providing advanced knowledge processing capabilities.

### Core Components
- **Knowledge Graph Builder**: Extracts entities and relationships from enterprise data
- **Vector Embedding Engine**: Creates semantic embeddings for knowledge elements
- **GraphRAG Processor**: Combines graph and vector search for contextual retrieval
- **AI Agent Runtime**: Executes intelligent agents with access to knowledge graphs
- **Integration Layer**: Connects with external LLMs, databases, and enterprise systems

### Data Flow
1. **Ingestion**: Raw data from various sources (documents, databases, APIs)
2. **Processing**: Entity extraction, relationship identification, and graph construction
3. **Embedding**: Vector representation of knowledge elements
4. **Storage**: Persistent storage in graph and vector databases
5. **Query**: AI agents query knowledge graphs for contextual information
6. **Response**: Contextually-aware responses based on relationship understanding

## Storage Layer

### Knowledge Graph Storage
Supports multiple graph database backends including Neo4j, ArangoDB, and others. Stores entities, relationships, and metadata in optimized graph structures.

### Vector Database Integration
Integrates with popular vector databases like Pinecone, Weaviate, and Chroma for semantic similarity search and hybrid retrieval.

### Knowledge Packages
Combines graph and vector storage into unified "Knowledge Packages" that provide both structured relationships and semantic search capabilities.

## Processing Layer

### Entity Extraction Engine
Uses advanced NLP techniques to identify entities, relationships, and concepts from unstructured data sources.

### Relationship Mapping
Builds sophisticated relationship maps that understand how different entities connect and influence each other.

### GraphRAG Processing
Implements Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation that leverages both graph structure and vector similarity for enhanced context retrieval.

### AI Agent Orchestration
Manages the execution of multiple AI agents with access to shared knowledge graphs and contextual information.

## Integration Layer

### LLM Integration
Supports multiple Large Language Models through standardized interfaces, enabling organizations to use their preferred models.

### Enterprise Data Connectors
Built-in connectors for common enterprise systems including databases, document management systems, and APIs.

### API Gateway
Provides unified access to all TrustGraph capabilities through REST APIs, GraphQL, and WebSocket connections.

## Deployment Architecture

### Containerized Deployment
Fully containerized using Docker with Kubernetes orchestration for scalable, cloud-native deployments.

### Microservices Design
Modular architecture allows independent scaling of different components based on workload requirements.

### Multi-Cloud Support
Designed to run on any cloud platform or on-premises infrastructure with consistent performance and capabilities.

### Security & Compliance
Built-in security features including data encryption, access controls, and audit logging to meet enterprise security requirements.

## Scalability & Performance

### Horizontal Scaling
Components can be scaled independently based on demand, from knowledge graph construction to AI agent execution.

### Distributed Processing
Supports distributed processing for large-scale knowledge graph construction and complex query processing.

### Caching & Optimization
Intelligent caching strategies and query optimization ensure fast response times even with large knowledge graphs.
