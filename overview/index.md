## What is TrustGraph?

TrustGraph is an **Open Source Agent Intelligence Platform** that helps organizations build, deploy, and manage sophisticated AI agents with deep contextual understanding. Unlike traditional AI systems that work with isolated data points, TrustGraph creates interconnected Knowledge Graphs from enterprise data, enabling agents to understand relationships and context.

### Key Capabilities

- **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Transform fragmented enterprise data into interconnected knowledge structures
- **GraphRAG Technology**: Advanced Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation that goes beyond standard RAG approaches
- **Contextual AI Agents**: Build agents that understand relationships between data points, not just isolated facts
- **Open Source Transparency**: Full visibility into data processing with no vendor lock-in
- **Enterprise Integration**: Unify siloed organizational data into coherent knowledge systems

### Why TrustGraph?

Traditional AI agents often struggle with hallucinations and lack of context. TrustGraph solves this by:
- Creating "Knowledge Packages" that combine Knowledge Graphs with Vector Embeddings
- Enabling agents to perform contextual reasoning rather than simple pattern matching
- Providing radical transparency in how AI systems process and understand data
- Supporting integration with multiple LLMs, vector databases, and graph databases
