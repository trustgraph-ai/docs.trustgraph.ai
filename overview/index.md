## Quick Answers

### What is TrustGraph?

TrustGraph is an **Open Source Agent Intelligence Platform** that transforms AI agents from simple task executors into contextually-aware systems. It combines:
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Interconnected entity-relationship structures
- **Vector Embeddings**: Semantic similarity search
- **GraphRAG**: Relationship-aware retrieval for AI responses
- **Agent Runtime**: Execution environment with contextual understanding

### Why Use TrustGraph?

**For AI Developers**: Build agents that understand context and relationships, not just isolated facts.

**For Data Scientists**: Query knowledge using both structured relationships and semantic similarity.

**For Enterprises**: Unify fragmented organizational knowledge into coherent, queryable systems.

**For Everyone**: Reduce AI hallucinations by grounding responses in structured knowledge.

### How is TrustGraph Different?

| Traditional RAG | TrustGraph GraphRAG |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Vector similarity only | Graph relationships + vectors |
| Isolated documents | Connected knowledge |
| Limited context | Rich contextual understanding |
| Prone to hallucinations | Grounded in structured data |

### Key Technologies

- **Knowledge Graphs**: Entities and relationships extracted from documents
- **GraphRAG**: Graph-enhanced retrieval and generation
- **Knowledge Packages**: Combined graph + vector representations
- **Structured Query**: Natural language to GraphQL conversion
- **Agent Intelligence**: Contextual reasoning and transparency
