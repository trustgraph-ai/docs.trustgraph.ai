## Why Graph-Based Context Matters

Traditional RAG approaches rely on vector similarity alone, which can miss critical relationships between pieces of information. TrustGraph's GraphRAG approach:

- **Surfaces causal relationships** — Understand not just what's similar, but what's connected
- **Enables multi-hop reasoning** — Follow chains of relationships to find relevant context
- **Reduces hallucinations** — Ground responses in verified knowledge structures
- **Provides transparency** — Clear audit trails from question to answer
