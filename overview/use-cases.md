# Use Cases

Discover how TrustGraph can be applied to solve real-world AI and knowledge management challenges.

## Enterprise Applications

### Knowledge Management
Transform scattered enterprise documentation, databases, and institutional knowledge into interconnected knowledge graphs. Enable AI agents to provide contextual answers that understand how different pieces of information relate to each other.

### Customer Support Intelligence
Build AI agents that understand the full context of customer interactions, product relationships, and support history. Provide more accurate and contextually relevant support responses.

### Research & Development
Create knowledge graphs from research papers, patent databases, and internal R&D documentation. Enable AI agents to identify connections between different research areas and suggest novel approaches.

### Regulatory Compliance
Map complex regulatory requirements and their relationships to business processes. Enable AI agents to provide contextual compliance guidance that understands how different regulations interconnect.

### Supply Chain Intelligence
Model complex supply chain relationships and dependencies. Enable AI agents to provide insights about supply chain risks and opportunities based on interconnected data.

### Financial Analysis
Connect financial data, market information, and business intelligence into comprehensive knowledge graphs. Enable AI agents to perform more sophisticated financial analysis and risk assessment.

## Common Scenarios

### Intelligent Document Processing
Go beyond simple document retrieval to understand how documents relate to each other. AI agents can provide answers that span multiple documents and understand contextual relationships.

### Decision Support Systems
Build AI agents that can reason about complex business decisions by understanding the relationships between different factors, stakeholders, and outcomes.

### Competitive Intelligence
Create knowledge graphs that connect market data, competitor information, and industry trends. Enable AI agents to provide strategic insights based on comprehensive relationship understanding.

### Expert Systems
Capture and formalize expert knowledge in knowledge graphs. Enable AI agents to provide expert-level guidance while maintaining transparency about the reasoning process.

### Data Integration & Unification
Break down data silos by creating unified knowledge graphs that connect information across different systems and departments.

## Implementation Patterns

### GraphRAG Implementation
Implement Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation to improve AI response quality by leveraging relationship understanding rather than simple document similarity.

### Multi-Source Knowledge Integration
Combine data from multiple sources (databases, documents, APIs) into coherent knowledge graphs that preserve relationships and context.

### Incremental Knowledge Building
Start with core knowledge domains and gradually expand knowledge graphs as more data becomes available and new relationships are discovered.

### Contextual AI Agent Development
Build AI agents that understand not just what information exists, but how different pieces of information connect and influence each other.

## Success Factors

### Data Quality & Relationships
Success depends on identifying and accurately modeling the relationships between different data entities.

### Iterative Development
Knowledge graphs improve over time as more data is processed and relationships are refined.

### Domain Expertise
Combining domain expertise with TrustGraph's technology ensures that knowledge graphs accurately represent real-world relationships.

### Integration Strategy
Successful implementations integrate TrustGraph with existing tools and workflows rather than requiring complete system replacement.
