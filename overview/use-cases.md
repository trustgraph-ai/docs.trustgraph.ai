## Why Graph-Based Context Matters

Traditional RAG approaches rely on vector similarity alone, which can miss critical relationships. TrustGraph's GraphRAG approach:

- **Shows reasoning paths** — Trace answers back to specific entities and relationships
- **Enables multi-hop questions** — Answer queries that require traversing multiple connections
- **Reduces hallucinations** — Ground responses in verified knowledge structures
- **Supports complex queries** — Handle "what if" scenarios and impact analysis that span systems
