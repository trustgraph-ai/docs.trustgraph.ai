TrustGraph includes a web interface for document processing and Graph RAG.

Access the TrustGraph workbench at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) (requires port-forwarding to be running).

By default, there are no credentials.

You should be able to navigate to the Flows tab and see a single *default* flow running. The guide will return to the workbench to load a document.
