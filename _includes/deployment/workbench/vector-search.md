Select the *Vector Search* tab. Enter a string (e.g., "document") in the search bar and hit RETURN. The search term doesn't matter a great deal. If information has started to load, you should see some search results.

The vector search attempts to find up to 10 terms which are the closest matches for your search term. It does this even if the search terms are not a strong match, so this is a simple way to observe whether data has loaded.
