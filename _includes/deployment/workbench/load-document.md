Back in the workbench:

1. Navigate to the Library page
2. In the upper right-hand corner, there is a dark/light mode widget. To its left is a selector widget. Ensure the top and bottom lines say "default". If not, click on the widget and change.
3. On the library tab, select a document (e.g., "Beyond State Vigilance")
4. Click Submit on the action bar
5. Choose a processing flow (use Default processing flow)
6. Click Submit to process

Beyond State Vigilance is a relatively short document, so it's a good one to start with.
