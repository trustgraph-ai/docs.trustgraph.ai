# Contributing Guidelines

We welcome contributions to TrustGraph — code, documentation, bug reports, feature ideas, and feedback.

## Getting Started

The best starting point is to reach out on the **#contributing** channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/sQMwkRz5GX). We want to help you with design guidance and merge support so your contribution is plain sailing.

## Contribution Process

1. **Discuss** — Share your idea on Discord #contributing to get early feedback
2. **Fork & branch** — Create a branch from the latest `release/vX.Y` branch
3. **Develop** — Make your changes (see [Development Setup](development-guide) and [Development Workflow](developer))
4. **Submit PR** — Push your branch and create a pull request
5. **Sign CLA** — The PR bot will prompt you to sign our Contributor License Agreement (one-time)
6. **Review** — We'll review and work with you to get it merged

## Contributor License Agreement

We use a CLA from [contributoragreements.org](https://contributoragreements.org). When you submit your first PR, a bot will prompt you to sign electronically — it's quick and only required once.

View the agreement: [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/trustgraph-ai/contributor-license-agreement)

## What We're Looking For

- **Bug fixes** — Issues tagged `good first issue` are a great starting point
- **New processors** — Extend TrustGraph's capabilities
- **Documentation** — Improvements, tutorials, examples
- **Tests** — Expanded coverage is always welcome

## Questions?
