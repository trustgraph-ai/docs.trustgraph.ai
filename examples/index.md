# Examples

**Working code samples, datasets, and complete implementations you can copy and use.**

Examples provide **ready-to-use code and data** that demonstrate TrustGraph features in action. Unlike guides that teach you *how* to do something, examples show you *what* working implementations look like.

## What's in This Section?

**Examples** include:
- Complete working code samples
- Sample datasets and data generators
- Integration examples with real systems
- Reference implementations

**Not sure if you're in the right place?**
- Want step-by-step instructions? See [How-to Guides](../guides/)
- Want to understand concepts? See [Overview](../overview/)
- Want API documentation? See [Reference](../reference/)

## Available Examples

### Sample Data
- **[Sample Data](sample-data/)** - Example datasets for testing and development
  - Pre-built knowledge graphs
  - Sample documents (PDFs, text files)
  - Test data generators

### Working Code
- **[NLP to Structured Queries](nlp-structured-queries)** - Convert natural language to GraphQL queries

## Planned Examples

{: .wip }
> **Work in Progress**
> The following examples are planned for future releases:

- **[Tutorials](tutorials/)** - Complete end-to-end learning paths
- **[Integrations](integrations/)** - Real-world system integration examples
  - LangChain integration
  - LlamaIndex integration
  - Custom API integration
  - Database connectors

## How to Use Examples

### 1. Browse Examples
Find an example that matches your use case

### 2. Copy the Code
Examples are designed to be copied and adapted

### 3. Run & Modify
Test the example, then customize for your needs

### 4. Refer to Guides
For deeper understanding, see related [How-to Guides](../guides/)

## Example Categories

### By Use Case

| Use Case | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Testing TrustGraph | [Sample Data](sample-data/) |
| Natural language queries | [NLP to Structured Queries](nlp-structured-queries) |

## Examples vs. Guides: What's the Difference?

| Examples | Guides |
|----------|--------|
| **What**: Working code to copy | **How**: Step-by-step instructions |
| **Goal**: Show implementation | **Goal**: Teach a task |
| **Format**: Complete code samples | **Format**: Instructional steps |
| **When to use**: Need code quickly | **When to use**: Learning workflow |

**Example scenario**:
- **Guide**: "How to Extract Entities from PDFs" - teaches the process
- **Example**: "PDF Entity Extraction Sample" - provides working code

## Sample Datasets

The [Sample Data](sample-data/) section provides:
- Pre-loaded knowledge graphs for testing
- Sample PDFs and documents
- Data generators for creating test data
- Benchmark datasets

Perfect for:
- Testing your TrustGraph installation
- Learning query patterns
- Benchmarking performance
- Developing and testing features
