# TrustGraph Documentation

**Build intelligent AI agents with knowledge graphs and GraphRAG**

TrustGraph is an open-source Agent Intelligence Platform that transforms AI agents from simple task executors into contextually-aware systems. By combining knowledge graphs with vector embeddings, TrustGraph enables AI agents to understand relationships, reduce hallucinations, and provide more accurate responses.
