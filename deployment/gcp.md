# Google Cloud Platform Deployment

Deploy TrustGraph on Google Cloud Platform using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and other GCP services.

## Overview

TrustGraph provides a complete GCP deployment solution using **Pulumi** (Infrastructure as Code) that automatically provisions and configures all necessary GCP resources for a production-ready TrustGraph deployment.

## What You Get

The GCP deployment includes:

- **GKE Kubernetes cluster** with 2-node pool
- **Service accounts** with VertexAI access
- **Complete TrustGraph stack** deployed and configured
- **VertexAI Gemini Flash 1.5** LLM integration
- **Secrets management** for secure configuration
- **Monitoring and observability** with Grafana
- **Web workbench** for document processing and Graph RAG

## Deployment Method

The deployment uses **Pulumi**, an Infrastructure as Code tool that:

- Has an open-source license
- Uses general-purpose programming languages (TypeScript/JavaScript)
- Provides testable infrastructure code
- Offers retryable deployments
- Supports local or cloud state management

## Quick Process Overview

1. **Install Pulumi** and dependencies
2. **Configure GCP credentials** using `gcloud auth login`
3. **Customize configuration** in `Pulumi.STACKNAME.yaml`
4. **Deploy** with `pulumi up`
5. **Access services** via port-forwarding or load balancers

## Access Points

Once deployed, you'll have access to:

- **TrustGraph API**: Port 8088
- **Web Workbench**: Port 8888 (document processing, Graph RAG)
- **Grafana Monitoring**: Port 3000
