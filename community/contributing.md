# Contributing

We welcome contributors to the TrustGraph Github project.

We operate a contributor licence agreement, from contributoragreements.org.

The contributor agreement is here:
[https://github.com/trustgraph-ai/contributor-license-agreement](https://github.com/trustgraph-ai/contributor-license-agreement)

If you are happy to proceed with this agreement you can create a
pull-request.  The pull-request will stall until you automatically sign
the contributor agreement.
