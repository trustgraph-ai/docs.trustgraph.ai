# Contributing

We welcome contributors to the TrustGraph Github project.

We operate a contributor licence agreement, from contributoragreements.org.

The contributor agreement is here:
[https://github.com/trustgraph-ai/contributor-license-agreement](https://github.com/trustgraph-ai/contributor-license-agreement)

If you are happy to proceed with this agreement you can create a
pull-request.  The pull-request will stall until you automatically sign
the contributor agreement.

## Development Process

For detailed information about the development workflow, including:
- Git branching strategy and release process
- Testing environment setup
- Working with AI assistants during development
- Best practices for modular development

Please see the [Developer Guide](developer).
